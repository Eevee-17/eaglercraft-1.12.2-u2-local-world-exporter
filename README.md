# eaglercraft-1.12.2-u2-local-world-exporter
Lets you export the entire filesystem stored for Eaglercraft 1.12.2 u2 running as a local file.

**If you run the game on a website on the internet, this will NOT work.** You would need to transfer the data over to the IndexedDB for local files.

I have only tested this on Chrome.

Also, this was just a silly project, so there probably won't be too much support for this program in the future. Also, the code is kind of bad... sorry.

This project uses [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip).
